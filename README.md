  </p>
</div>

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-killswitch
```

## Usage

The bare minimum needed to have a working killswitch is API keys for iOS and Android,
the app language and the app version:

```js
import { useKillswitch } from 'react-native-killswitch';

const { isOk } = useKillswitch({
  iosApiKey: iosApiKey,
  androidApiKey: androidApiKey,
  language: myAppLanguage,
  version: myAppVersion,
});
```

### Options

- `iosApiKey`
  A string taken from your killswitch back-end. The killswitch back-end will use
  this to send the correct behavior to your iOS users.

- `androidApiKey`
  A string taken from your killswitch back-end. The killswitch back-end will use
  this to send the correct behavior to your Android users.

- `language`
  A language code like "en" or "de". The killswitch back-end will use this to
  send a localized message to your users.

- `version`
  A version number like "1.0.0". The killswitch back-end will use this to send
  the correct behavior to your users.

- `apiHost`
  The host of the killswitch back-end.

- `useNativeUI`
  Use native alerts to display messages. Defaults to `true`

- `timeout`
  A number of milliseconds to wait for the back-end before returning `isOk = true`. Defaults to `2000`
